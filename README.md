Hellohello. I'm drakathedread, a casual developer and innovation enthusiast. 
At the end of 2021 I started Google's Kotlin Basics training to finally act on my goal to become a developer.

I'll be uploading my apps just for fun, maybe I'll do some extra projects also, apart from the course. And after that, limits are only the stars!

Greetings currently from the Netherlands, Wageningen Universtiy and Research.
